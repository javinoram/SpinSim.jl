# SpinSim.jl

Welcome to this small package to construct the matrix representation of some spin model.
This matrices are expected to be used for magnetocaloric studies or analize the spectral decomposition.


This is the recopilation of all the work done to simulate and publish the result of the 3Ni SMM.
